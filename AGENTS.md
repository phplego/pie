# Development Guidelines

## Core Principles

1. **Simplicity First**
   - Write only what is necessary
   - Avoid adding unnecessary complexity
   - Keep code clean and focused on core functionality

2. **Modern Browser Focus**
   - Target only modern browsers
   - No need to support legacy browsers
   - Utilize modern JavaScript and CSS features without polyfills

3. **Pragmatic Error Handling**
   - If an error is naturally displayed by the browser, don't add additional handling
   - Focus error handling on critical user experience issues
   - Use browser's built-in error reporting where appropriate

4. **Keep Everything in One File**
   - Consolidate HTML, CSS, and JavaScript in a single file for simplicity
